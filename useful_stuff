Troubleshoting:
    When installed packages aren't recognised:
        Check >Python Interpreter in Command Palette to make sure it's pointing to the right python installation.
    Issues with conflicting package versions:
        # This will blow away the node_modules directory, the package-lock.json file, and reinstall the all packages.
        # Make sure any dependencies on specific versions are updated in the package.json file.
        Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules
        Remove-Item -Force .\package-lock.json
        npm install

Use Hot Reloading to see changes in real-time:
    # The scripts in package.json have been updated to start the client and server by calling start.
    # Make sure you've run npm install concurrently --save-dev 
    # This will start the flask server and the react server in watch mode and changes will be reflected in the browser in real-time.
    # Application will be running at http://localhost:3000/
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # if not already in the virtual environment
    cd satisfactory_tracker\react_stuff # if not already in the react_stuff directory
    npm start

Build and Run Application:
    # This will activate the virtual env, run the npm build, start the flask server, the react server and open the browser to the react server.
    # Application will be running at http://localhost:3000/
    python run_app.py # in root directory. 
    
Virtual environment:
    Create:
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
        npm install # and copy the line from npm_requirements.txt to install the required packages.
    Delete:
        Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\venv
            (Alternatively, you can manually delete the venv directory using File Explorer.)
    Turn on virtual environment:
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
    Turn off virtual environment:
        deactivate

npm commands:
    npm run build
    npm start

Start the front-end and back-end servers:
    npm start # uses concurrently to start the both react and flask servers in the package.json script
